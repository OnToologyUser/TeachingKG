# Use-case and data collection interface

Interface is in alpha version, and is generated with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io)

A neo4j database is required for storing the information collected on the interface. 

DB password should be modified in the function `init_neo4j_connection()` accordingly.

## Run the code from the root directory with `streamlit run main_extended_alpha_version.py`
